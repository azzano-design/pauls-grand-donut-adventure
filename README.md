# Paul's Grand Donut Adventure
## Snackathon submission

The prompt was to create something (anything) with one button only.

Here is a fun game you can play using on the spacebar (and mouse movement - but that's not a button now is it?).

Created with Godot and a slew of AI tools. Full credits below.
